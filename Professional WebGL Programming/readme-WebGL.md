Professional WebGL Programming - Developing 3D Graphics for the Web
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code that comes with the book is contained in this archive. 
Each code listing in the book that has a "download icon" is available in a folder in this archive.
For the code listings in Chapter 1 to Chapter 6 each code listing in the book corresponds to one folder in the archive.
  
For example the source code in the folder:
  
  Listing-3-2-lines-triangle-strip
  
Corresponds to Listing 3-2, which is discussed in Chapter 3. 

Chapter 7 is slightly different structured. Here three of the folders contain two code listings each. 
For example the following folder contains the source code that corresponds to both Listing 7-1 and Listing 7-2 in the book:

  Listing-7-1-and-7-2-per-vertex-lighting-Phong-reflection-model-no-textures
  
You can actually see from the folder name that this folder corresponds to two listings in the book.
  
Here is an overview of the code in the different chapters:

  Chapter 1:
    Listing-1-1-html5-canvas
    Listing-1-2-SVG
  Chapter 2:
    Listing-2-1-Basic-WebGL-Example
    Listing-2-2-Loading-Shaders-From-DOM
  Chapter 3:
    Listing-3-1-interleave-pos-color
    Listing-3-2-lines-triangle-strip
  Chapter 4:
    Listing-4-1-sylvester
    Listing-4-2-WebGL-mjs
    Listing-4-3-glMatrix
    Listing-4-4-plane-table-cube
  Chapter 5:
    Listing-5-1-textures
  Chapter 6:
    Listing-6-1-animation-and-user-input
  Chapter 7:
    Listing-7-1-and-7-2-per-vertex-lighting-Phong-reflection-model-no-textures
    Listing-7-3-and-7-4-per-vertex-lighting-Phong-reflection-with-texture
    Listing-7-5-and-7-6-lighting-Phong-shading
    Listing-7-7-lighting-spot-on-textured-floor
    Listing-7-8-lighting-point-with-attenuation-calc-dist-in-fs
  Chapter 8:
    Does not have any code to download

    
Please note that some of the folders also contain open source JavaScript libraries written by others. 
You can see in each JavaScript file who has the copyright. 
Here you see a summary of the copyright holders whom I want to acknowledge for their great work (for details look in the respective file):

  webgl-debug.js - Copyright (c) 2009 The Chromium Authors
  sylvester.src.js - Copyright (c) 2007 James Coglan
  mjs.js - Copyright (c) 2010 Mozilla Corporation, Copyright (c) 2010 Vladimir Vukicevic
  glMatrix.js - Copyright (c) 2011 Brandon Jones
  webgl-utils.js - Copyright 2010, Google Inc.
  image files - based on images from www.cgtextures.com

The libraries have been included here since they provide functionality that is used in the code listings. 
In addition some folders contain images that are used as textures. These images originally come from www.cgtextures.com 
but have been scaled down from their original resolution.

Thank you, and enjoy your WebGL programming!
